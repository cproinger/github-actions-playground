# github-actions-playground

In this repo i play with differnt github actions


## conventional commits

In order to use github-actions that parse commit-messages we enforce commit-message style (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with husky (https://typicode.github.io/husky/)

May introduce https://github.com/ridvanaltun/commitlint-plugin-selective-scope later to define valid 
scopes per type.
